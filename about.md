Hello, my name is Jithendra Yenugula.

Currently, I work as a **Data Engineer** at [NeenOpal Inc.](https://www.neenopal.com/) where I implement cloud-based ETL and data warehousing solutions for a global clientele. I've successfully delivered end-to-end projects across diverse industries—including logistics, ed-tech, and finance — delivering scalable and efficient ETL solutions and architectures.

As a programmer, I code mostly in Python. I’m an AWS Certified Associate Solutions Architect and Microsoft Certified Azure Data Engineer.

### A few more things about me
- I grew up in [Eluru](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eluru), a simple little town in Andhra Pradesh, India.
- I live by the timeless Stoic principle, 'Memento Mori'—remember, you must die. This encourages me to remember that tomorrow is not promised, live now, embrace the temporality of it all.
- I’m a metalhead who finds solace in doom and death metal, and I’m always up for a good horror movie marathon.
- Philosophy books are my go-to reads, especially those that dive into the depths of human nature and existential questions. Right now, I’m reading works by Fyodor Dostoevsky.
- The name of my cat <a href="/images/judas-2.jpg">Judas</a>, is inspired from my favorite song —"[Kiss of Judas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaatBMAAt_Y)", and one of my favorite bands —"[Judas Priest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judas_Priest)".
